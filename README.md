# Spiral Sounds

**Spiral Sounds** is a full-stack vinyl record store web application that displays a curated list of music records from a database. Users can browse all records, filter by genre, and search for specific titles. This project demonstrates a wide range of web development concepts using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Express**, and **SQL**.

---

## Features

*  View a catalog of vinyl records with album art, artist name, price, and genre.
*  Filter records based on genre.
*  Search functionality to find specific albums.
*  Add to Cart button (non-functional placeholder in current version).

---

## Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla)
* **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
* **Database**: SQLite / PostgreSQL (based on implementation)

## ðŸ“† Learning Objectives

This project is designed to help you understand:

### 1. Middleware

* Logging, parsing, error handling.

### 2. Serving Static Files

* Serve HTML, CSS, images, and JS using `express.static()`.

### 3. Creating a Database

* Schema design for vinyl records.

### 4. Seeding a Database

* Insert initial data into your records table.

### 5. Retrieving Data

* Write SQL queries to fetch all records or filter by genre.

### 6. SQL Bindings

* Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Functionality

### âœ… Serve All Assets

* Use middleware to serve all frontend files.

### âœ… Display All Products

* On page load, fetch all products from the database.

### âœ… Display Filtered Products

* Based on user interaction (dropdown / search), query the backend accordingly.
